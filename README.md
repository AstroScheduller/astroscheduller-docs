# The AstroScheduller Project Documentations

The AstroScheduller project is developing a user-friendly Python package with an algorithm for planning astronomical observations. This project was taken from a previous project [AstroScheduller.py](https://github.com/AstroScheduller/AstroSchedullerPy). 

### The way the documentation is organized

The AstroScheduller Documentation is organized in three main parts:

#### Tutorials

​      A general description of what the package can do, and non-technical instructions on how to use the package. In addition, installation instructions are included in **`Getting Started: Installation <./tutorials-docs/getting-started.html>`__**.

#### Examples

​      Examples on how to use the AstroScheduller package. Most of these examples are demonstrated in the tutorials and are provided in the .ipynb and .py files.

#### Reference

​      A technical description of how specific functions work. This section of the documentation is intended for those who want to learn more about the package and/or are involved in developing the package.

These documentations are hosted on the Github Pages: https://astroscheduller.github.io/.

The documentation pages were built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) using a [theme](https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme) provided by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). The structure of the documentation is inspired by both the [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/) and [PINT Is Not TEMPO3](https://github.com/nanograv/PINT).
