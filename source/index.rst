The AstroScheduller Project
===========================================
The AstroScheduller project is developing a user-friendly Python package with an algorithm for planning astronomical observations. This project was taken from a previous project `AstroScheduller.py <https://github.com/AstroScheduller/AstroSchedullerPy>`__. 

The way the documentation is organized
-------------------------------------------
The AstroScheduller Documentation is organized in three main parts:

:ref:`Tutorials`
      A general description of what the package can do, and non-technical instructions on how to use the package. In addition, installation instructions are included in `Getting Started: Installation <./tutorials-docs/getting-started.html>`__.

:ref:`Examples`
      Examples on how to use the AstroScheduller package. Most of these examples are demonstrated in the tutorials and are provided in the .ipynb and .py files.
   
:ref:`Reference`
      A technical description of how specific functions work. This section of the documentation is intended for those who want to learn more about the package and/or are involved in developing the package.
